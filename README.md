# Blackjack


This is an application where you play blackjack. If you're unfamiliar with the game, here are some basic rules to get you started.

  - You start with two cards, and make a choice if you want another card or not
  - The game is over when you have 21 or more points, or you click stay
  - Whoever is closer to 21, without going over, wins.

# How do I play?

  - Both the client and the server are live on Heroku.
  - You can play here: https://blackjack-app-client.herokuapp.com/
  - Beware, the page might require a refresh, as it's using free dynos.
  - You can create your own account, or use my demo account!
  - Username: test
  - Password: pass123


If you do create your own account:
  - Check out your stats by clicking on your username at the top of the page
  - Everybody starts with $100, use it carefully!
  - If you do run out, don't worry about it. We'll give you some more.
  - We'll keep track of your bankruptcies on your profile page :)

### Future Plans

The game is currently in a kind of bare bones state of blackjack. What I mean by that is that it doesn't currently have every feature or option you would have at an actual blackjack table in a casino. It's in my future plans to add splitting, doubling down, and other things that would usually feature in an actual game of blackjack.
